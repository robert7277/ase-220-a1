        with a minor in Women's and Gender study's. I live in covington in my own house. I may be the oldest student in the
        class at 30. currently i work at St Elizabeth Florence as a lead for the Kitchen. My hobbies would be video games,
        reading and tinkering with my two servers/ other computer devices. I have two cats, a dog and a pet snake. My
