    <div>I am a senior CIT student graduating this summer. This will be my second BS, my first degree was in Sociology
    with a minor in Women's and Gender study's. I live in covington in my own house. I may be the oldest student in the
    class at 30. currently i work at St Elizabeth Florence as a lead for the Kitchen. My hobbies would be video games,
    reading and tinkering with my two servers/ other computer devices. I have two cats, a dog and a pet snake. My
    favorite author is Ursala K. Le Guin. </div>
